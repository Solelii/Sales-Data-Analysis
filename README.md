## 🔧 Project Outline: 3 Mini Projects (Progressively Advanced)

---

### 📊 Project 1: Sales Data Analysis (Statistical + Visual)

**Objective:** Perform quantitative analysis and visualize business trends.

#### Tasks:
- Load a CSV dataset (e.g., `sales_data.csv`) using `pandas`.
- Clean the data (handle missing values, correct data types).
- Perform statistical analysis:
  - Calculate average sales per month
  - Identify top 5 best-selling products
  - Analyze sales growth over time
- Visualize results using:
  - Line chart (e.g., monthly sales trend)
  - Bar chart (e.g., top 5 products by revenue)

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Data wrangling & basic statistics
- Data visualization

### ⚙️ Project 2: Automation Script — Daily Report Generator

**Objective:** Automate a manual reporting task using Python.

#### Tasks:
- Connect to a MySQL database (`mysql-connector-python` or `SQLAlchemy`)
- Run a SQL query (e.g., yesterday’s sales)
- Process and summarize the data
- Export the report to Excel or PDF
- *(Optional)* Send the report via email using `smtplib`

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- SQL and Python integration
- Python scripting for automation
- Report generation (file I/O)

---

### 📈 Project 3: Looker Studio Integration

**Objective:** Build a live dashboard using cleaned data.

#### Tasks:
- Use processed data from Project 1 or 2
- Format the data and upload to Google Sheets via `gspread`
- Connect Google Sheets to Looker Studio
- Design a dashboard with:
  - Time-based trendlines
  - Filters for product/category
  - Comparison metrics (e.g., this week vs. last week)

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Data preparation for visualization
- Google Sheets API
- Looker Studio dashboarding

## 🧠 Bonus Add-Ons (To Really Impress)

- Use **Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab** to present your analysis with markdowns and visualizations.
- Publish your work on **GitHub** with clear documentation.
- Prepare a short **Google Slides** deck (5 slides):
  - Problem → Data → Analysis → Automation → Results
