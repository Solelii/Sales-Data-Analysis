## üîç General Workflow  

1. **Data Assessment**  
   - Load the raw dataset and inspect overall structure  
   - Identify missing values, duplicates, and obvious outliers  
   - Summarize key fields (e.g. date ranges, product counts, revenue distribution)  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Remove or impute missing and invalid records  
   - Standardize data types (dates, categories, numerics)  
   - Deduplicate and filter extreme outliers  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Derive time‚Äëbased fields (year, month, weekday)  
   - Calculate aggregate metrics (total revenue, average price)  
   - Flag special events or promotions if available  

4. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Aggregate revenue and volume by time period  
   - Compute growth rates (month‚Äëover‚Äëmonth, year‚Äëover‚Äëyear)  
   - Segment performance by product, category, or region  

5. **Visualization Planning**  
   - Choose static charts for high‚Äëlevel trends (line, bar, heatmap)  
   - Identify interactive views for deeper drill‚Äëdown (hover, filters)  
   - Sketch dashboard layouts and key KPI scorecards  

6. **Data Export & Integration**  
   - Prepare cleaned dataset for downstream use (CSV, Google Sheets, etc.)  
   - Validate that BI tools can connect and refresh automatically  

7. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Configure charts, scorecards, and filters in Looker Studio (or equivalent)  
   - Arrange components for clear storytelling and easy navigation  
   - Test interactivity (date ranges, category filters, drill‚Äëdowns)  

8. **Documentation & Handoff**  
   - Draft a concise README with overview, folder structure, and usage steps  
   - Include screenshots or links to live dashboard  
   - Provide setup instructions (dependencies, credentials, data sources)
